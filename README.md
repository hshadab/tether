# zkML Guardrails for Tether WDK + USDT0 on Plasma

> **Community contribution to the Tether ecosystem.** This project extends [baghdadgherras/x402-usdt0](https://github.com/baghdadgherras/x402-usdt0) — the reference x402 payment demo on Plasma — by adding zero-knowledge ML verification as a core primitive. Where the original demonstrates x402 payments with WDK + USDT0, this PoC adds cryptographic proof that an ML model authorized every transaction, making the payment rail tamper-evident and auditable. Built as a proof of concept for deeper Tether partnership.

**Zero-knowledge machine learning meets the Tether stack.** This project is a native integration of zkML-powered transaction guardrails into [Tether WDK](https://docs.wallet.tether.io), settling in [USDT0](https://usdt0.to) on [Plasma](https://www.plasma.to) — Tether's own chain.

Every piece of this system is built directly on Tether primitives:

| Layer | Tether Primitive | What It Does Here |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Wallet** | [Tether WDK](https://docs.wallet.tether.io) | Signs transactions, manages keys, executes transfers |
| **Token** | [USDT0](https://usdt0.to) | The payment unit — omnichain USDT via LayerZero |
| **Chain** | [Plasma](https://www.plasma.to) (chain ID 9745) | Where payments settle — Tether's own L1 |
| **Protocol** | [x402](https://www.x402.org/) | HTTP-native micropayments in USDT0 |

WDK is not a bolt-on — it's the signing and wallet layer. USDT0 is not a placeholder token — it's the real payment rail. Plasma is not a testnet fallback — it's the default network. This is what building on Tether as a first-class primitive looks like.

## What This Does

An ML model evaluates every transaction for risk — spending patterns, velocity, trust scores — before it can execute. But unlike server-side fraud checks that users have to trust blindly, the model runs inside a zero-knowledge VM ([Jolt Atlas](https://github.com/ICME-Lab/jolt-atlas)), producing a cryptographic proof that the evaluation actually happened. No one can skip the check, swap the model, or forge an approval.

**The Tether WDK connection:** The guardrails sit between `gatedTransfer()` and `account.transfer()`. The WDK wallet won't execute the transfer unless the zkML proof is valid and the cosigner has signed off. This is native WDK integration — the guardrails use WDK's own signing, key management, and transfer execution.

**The USDT0 connection:** Every payment in the x402 demo is denominated in real USDT0. The proof is cryptographically bound to the USDT0 token address, the payment amount, and the recipient — change any of these and the proof becomes invalid. This isn't a wrapped or synthetic token. It's USDT0 on Plasma.

**The Plasma connection:** Plasma is the default settlement chain. The x402 server, client, and facilitator all point to `rpc.plasma.to` (chain ID 9745) out of the box. Gas is paid in XPL. No configuration needed to run on Tether's chain.

Without a valid proof from the correct model, the cosigner won't sign and the WDK transfer can't execute.

## x402 Demo: Proof-Gated Payments in USDT0

The `x402-jolt-usdt0/` directory demonstrates zkML proofs integrated into the [x402 payment protocol](https://www.x402.org/) — HTTP-native micropayments where every request costs 0.0001 USDT0 on Plasma.

**How it works in plain English:**

A weather API charges a tiny fee per request. Instead of an API key, the client pays per-request using HTTP 402. Every payment must include a ZK proof that an ML model approved the transaction.

1. **Client requests weather data.** Server replies "402 Payment Required" — pay 0.0001 USDT0 to this address on Plasma.

2. **Client loads a ZK proof** pre-generated by the Rust prover (ONNX model running inside Jolt zkVM). The proof is cryptographically bound to the exact payment parameters — amount, recipient, chain ID 9745, and the USDT0 token address.

3. **Client signs the USDT0 payment** via WDK and retries the request with both the payment signature and ZK proof attached as HTTP headers.

4. **Server checks two gates:**
   - **Payment gate:** Is the USDT0 payment signature valid?
   - **Proof binding gate:** Does the ZK proof hash match these exact payment parameters? If an attacker changes the amount from 0.0001 to 10 USDT0, the SHA-256 binding hash won't match — rejected before anything hits Plasma.

5. **Cosigner verifies the SNARK** — confirming the ML model genuinely ran and approved.

6. **Weather data returned.** Payment settles in USDT0 on Plasma.

The demo includes three scenarios:
- **Normal flow** — proof and payment match, 200 OK
- **Tampered amount** — attacker inflates USDT0 amount, 403 rejected at binding check
- **Tampered recipient** — attacker redirects payment, 403 rejected at binding check

A React dashboard visualizes every step in real-time via Server-Sent Events.

See [`x402-jolt-usdt0/README.md`](x402-jolt-usdt0/README.md) for full setup and usage.

## Use Cases for Tether WDK Wallets

- **Fraud prevention** — Block suspicious USDT0 transfers before they leave the WDK wallet. The ML model catches unusual patterns and the proof guarantees the check actually ran.
- **Spending guardrails** — Enforce budgets, daily limits, and category restrictions on USDT0 transfers. Can't be bypassed — the proof is required.
- **Risk-based authorization** — Low-risk USDT0 transfers go through instantly. High-risk ones are blocked. The model decides, the proof ensures it was legitimate.
- **Auditable compliance** — Every USDT0 transfer carries a verifiable proof. Auditors verify proofs directly instead of trusting logs.
- **Theft protection** — Even with stolen credentials, the ML guardrails block transfers that don't match normal behavior. The attacker can't forge the proof.

## Quick Start

### x402 Demo (Plasma — Real USDT0)

```bash
# 1. Start the cosigner (verifies proofs)
cd cosigner
COSIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) cargo run --release

# 2. Fund the client wallet with USDT0 on Plasma
cd x402-jolt-usdt0
cp .env.example .env   # edit MNEMONIC, PAY_TO_ADDRESS, COSIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY
npm install
npm run fund-wallet    # shows address + balances + funding instructions

# 3. Generate proof cache (one-time)
npm run generate-cache

# 4. Start the server + dashboard
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

### WDK Client Demo (Sepolia Testnet)

```bash
cd client
npm install
export COSIGNER_URL=http://localhost:3001
export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/<your-key>
export SEED_PHRASE="<your-12-word-mnemonic>"
export TEST_USDT_ADDRESS=0x959413cfD31eBe4Bc81A57b284cD638b4Be88500
npm run demo
```

Runs two scenarios: low-risk (AUTHORIZED, transfer executes) and high-risk (DENIED, transfer blocked).

## Integration Example

```typescript
import { gatedTransfer } from "./gated-transfer";

// Drop-in replacement for account.transfer() in any WDK wallet
const result = await gatedTransfer(
  {
    budget: 15,      // User's remaining budget tier (0-15)
    trust: 7,        // Trust score (0-7)
    amount: 3,       // Amount category (0-15)
    category: 0,     // Spending category (0-3)
    velocity: 2,     // Recent transaction velocity (0-7)
    day: 1,          // Day of week (0-7)
    time: 1,         // Time of day bucket (0-3)
  },
  recipientAddress,
  "100000000", // 100 USDT0 (6 decimals)
  config,
  executeTransfer  // Your WDK transfer function
);

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Transfer complete: ${result.txHash}`);
} else {
  console.log(`Blocked: ${result.reason}`);
}
```

## How the Proof Works

1. **Model hash verification** — Both prover and cosigner compute SHA256 of the ONNX model. If they don't match, the proof is rejected. This prevents model swapping.

2. **SNARK proof** — Jolt generates a proof that the model execution was correct. The cosigner verifies this against pre-computed verification parameters.

3. **Output check** — The proof includes the model's output. The cosigner confirms the output class is "AUTHORIZED" (class 0).

4. **Replay protection** — Each approval includes a monotonic nonce. The same proof can't be reused.

## Relationship to x402-usdt0

This project builds on [baghdadgherras/x402-usdt0](https://github.com/baghdadgherras/x402-usdt0), which is the reference implementation of x402 payments on Plasma using the official `@x402/*` SDK and WDK packages (`@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm`, `@semanticpay/wdk-wallet-evm-x402-facilitator`).

The original demonstrates the complete x402 flow: client sends a request, server responds 402, client signs an EIP-3009 USDT0 payment, server verifies and settles on-chain. It's the foundation — clean x402 + WDK + USDT0 on Plasma.

**This project rebuilds that payment flow with zkML as a mandatory gate.** The x402 middleware was reimplemented (rather than wrapping `@x402/express`) because the ZK proof binding check needs to run *inside* the payment verification path, not alongside it. Every payment must carry a cryptographic proof that an ML model approved the transaction for these exact parameters.

**What the zkML layer adds:**

| | x402-usdt0 (original) | x402-jolt-usdt0 (this project) |
|---|---|---|
| Payment protocol | x402 via `@x402/*` SDK | x402 reimplemented with proof gates |
| Wallet | WDK (`@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm`) | WDK (via ethers adapter) |
| Token | USDT0 on Plasma | USDT0 on Plasma |
| Authorization | Payment signature only | Payment signature + SNARK proof of ML execution |
| Tamper detection | None — valid signature = valid payment | SHA-256 binding catches tampered amounts/recipients |
| ML verification | None | Jolt zkVM proves the ONNX model ran correctly |
| Cosigner | None | Rust SNARK verifier in the payment path |
| Attack demos | None | 3 scenarios (normal, tampered amount, tampered recipient) |

The goal is to show that zkML can be added as a native layer in the Tether payment stack — not as an external service, but as a cryptographic primitive that makes every USDT0 payment provably authorized.
